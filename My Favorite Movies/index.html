            <p>
                <br />
                Moneyball is a great movie starring Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletic's GM in the late 90's. <br />
                Moneyball tells the <i>cinderella story</i> of the Oakland A's and Billy Beane's journey to the longest winning <br />streak in MLB history, with the help of his assistant Paul DePodesta, played by Jonah Hill. This is overall <br />
                a great movie of hard work and great minds coming together to get make it to the top. Therefore,<br />
                this movie makes my Top 5 List.<br />
