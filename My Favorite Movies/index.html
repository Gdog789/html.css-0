    This is a list of my top 5 movies of all time. I think that these movies 
    all have something <br> that sets them apart from the rest and makes them
    especially good movies. Here is my list:

    <p>
        <img src="images/mb.jpg" width="150" height="225">
       <br> Moneyball is a great movie starring Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the
    Oakland Athletic's GM in the late 90's. <br> Moneyball tells the <i>cinderella story</i>
    of the Oakland A's and Billy Beane's journey to the longest winning <br>streak in MLB history, 
    with the help of his assistant Paul DePodesta, played by Jonah Hill. This is overall <br>
    a great movie of hard work and great minds coming together to get make it to the top. Therefore,<br>
    this movie makes my Top 5 List.<br>
